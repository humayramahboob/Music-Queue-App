# Overview

A fake app for collecting peoples cookie preferences and displaying them in sorted order

# API

```
request: {
    name: string
    cookie: string
}

response: {
    # list of preferences, sorted by name
    preferences: string[]
}
```

# How to start

In a terminal, run:

`python3 hello_world_server.py`

Then, in your browser, navigate to 

`file://<PATH_WHERE_YOUR_CODE_IS_SAVED>/hello_world.html`

For me, that looks like

`file:///Users/djhirsch/Documents/Hunter/hello_world.html`
